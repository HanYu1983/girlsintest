  "content": "The year 2015 is known as an Yi-Wei year (乙未年)</br>. Yi is the second of the 10 Heavenly Stems and Wei, the eighth of the 12 Early Branches, represents the Goat in the Chinese zodiac. In the Chinese calendar, a year is designated by combining one Heavenly Stem with another Earthly Branch. As a consequence, one such designated year appears every 60 years.This Yi-Wei year, which started on Feb. 19, marked the 120th anniversary of the end of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, known in Chinese history as Jia-Wu War (甲午戰爭) and Nisshin War (日清戰爭) in Japan. The Sino-Japanese War was followed by the Yi-Wei War (乙未戰爭), which in Western literature is named the Japanese invasion of Taiwan but should be called Taiwan's War of Independence.Japan considers the Yi-Wei War an extension of the Nisshin War, and officially regards it as a Taiwan Pacification War (台灣平定戰) that occurred in the course of the takeover of Taiwan, which the Qing Empire ceded under the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed on April 17, 1895. Gentry leaders on Taiwan, who wished to keep their island province at least under the suzerainty of the Qing Empire, created a republic of Taiwan that declared independence on May 23. In the declaration of independence, they proclaimed “Therefore, we, the People of Taiwan, in Council, have decided to constitute Taiwan as a Republican State, and all administration, henceforth, shall be in the hands of officials elected by the People of Taiwan. Tang Jing-song, Governor of Taiwan, has been appointed President of Taiwan.” Asia's first republic was born.War broke out four days earlier. Japan's First Imperial Guard Division landed at Aoti, present-day Fulung near Yilan in northeastern Taiwan, and began the pacification campaign."
